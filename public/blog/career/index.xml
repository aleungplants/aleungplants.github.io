      <description>Methods I downloaded publicly available names of researchers that received NSERC Postdoc Fellowships (PDFs) in the research subjects of Evolution and Ecology (Evo. &amp;amp; Eco.) and Plant and Tree Biology (Plant &amp;amp; Tree Bio.) from 1990-2023.
Winners of the NSERC PDFs from 1990-2020 were available from the Awards Database, whereas winners from 2020-2023 were available on Competition Results pages.
I looked them up on Google Scholar using the scholar::get_scholar_id() to get their Scholar ID.</description>

      <description>Methods I downloaded publicly available names of researchers that received NSERC Postdoc Fellowships from 2020-2024. I manually looked them up on Google Scholar and used the &amp;ldquo;scholar&amp;rdquo; package to download a list of their publications. I then filtered for papers that were published during or before the year that they received the fellowship. I summed the number of publications.
Additionally, using the order of the names, I also looked at how many first author publications they had.</description>

> In parallel computing, an **embarrassingly parallel** workload or problem (also called embarrassingly parallelizable, perfectly parallel, delightfully parallel or pleasingly parallel) is one where little or no effort is needed to split the problem into a number of parallel tasks. This is due to minimal or no dependency upon communication between the parallel tasks, or for results between them.

--["Embarrassingly parallel" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel)

One of FoldX's functions is predicting the effect of a mutation on the stability of a protein crystal structure, as indexed by the change in free energy of folding (∆∆*G*<sub>fold</sub>).

In BuildModel, you give it a `individual_list` file in which each line represents one or mutations to apply to the crystal structure, in the format of residue-chain-position-mutated residue, e.g., `MA309I;` mutates a methionine at site 309 on chain A to an isoleucine. You can multiple mutations, e.g., `MA309I,MB309I,MC309I,MD309I;` mutates chains A to D.

FoldX then iterates over the `individual_list` and spits out files with the predicted ∆∆*G*<sub>fold</sub> and its various subcomponents. Each line is independent from other lines in the `individual_list` file, so its jobs can be considered "embarrassingly parallel".

I needed to run a file with 174 different sets of mutations, which was going to take a loooong time on my computer. So, thanks to a suggestion by my colleague Matt, I ended up using GNU Parallel to split it up into 8 jobs to run across 8 cores.

I split up my `individual_list_mutations.txt` into approximately 8 equal chunks into their files into `individual_list_mutations_{}.txt` in Python:

```python

# Split into 8 chunks
input_file = "individual_list_mutations.txt"
with open(input_file, "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

total_lines = len(lines) # Calculate the number of lines per chunk and the remainder (if any)
print("Read", total_lines, "lines")

num_chunks = 8
chunk_size = total_lines // num_chunks
remainder = total_lines % num_chunks

chunks = [] # Split lines into chunks
start_index = 0
for i in range(num_chunks):
    # Distribute the remainder by adding 1 line to the first 'remainder' chunks
    end_index = start_index + chunk_size + (1 if i < remainder else 0)
    chunks.append(lines[start_index:end_index])
    print("Got chunk", str(i + 1), "with lines", start_index, "to", str(end_index - 1), ", inclusive")
    start_index = end_index

# Write each chunk to a new file
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks, 1):
    output_filename = "mutations_split/" + f"{input_file.rstrip('.txt')}_{i}.txt"
    with open(output_filename, "w") as output_file:
        output_file.writelines(chunk)
    print(f"Created: {output_filename}")

```

Using the `individual_list_mutations_{}.txt` files, I then used GNU Parallel in bash (on MSYS2, Windows) to run 8 instances of FoldX. One neat thing I did was have it send me a message on Pushover when a job was done (which is free up to 10000 messages a month, or you can upgrade for a one-time fee of USD$5).

Importantly, by default FoldX ignores water molecules (`--water=-IGNORE`), ascribes strong van der Waals forces, which requires a very precise crystal structure (`--vdwDesign=2`), and assumes an ion strength of 0.05 M(`--ionStrength=0.05`). So I made some tweaks to make it more applicable for my enzyme of interest.

Let me know what you think!

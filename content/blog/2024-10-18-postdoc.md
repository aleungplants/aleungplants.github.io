# Methods

I downloaded publicly available names of researchers that received NSERC Postdoc Fellowships from 2020-2024. I manually looked them up on Google Scholar and used the "scholar" package to download a list of their publications. I then filtered for papers that were published during or before the year that they received the fellowship. I summed the number of publications.

Additionally, using the order of the names, I also looked at how many first author publications they had. Note, I did not check if they were co-first author on any publications.

Finally, I used "sjrdata" to check how many of those first author pubs were in Q1 journals.

# Results

- There are fewer NSERC PDFs in Plant and Tree Biology (Plant Biol.) than in Evolution and Ecology (Evol. Ecol.)
- 50% of Evol. Ecol. NSERC postdocs had 8-17 pubs (median = 11), of which 4-7 were first author papers (median = 6), of which 3-7 were in Q1 journals (median = 5).
- 50% of Plant Biol. NSERC postdocs had 4.5-12 pubs (median = 8), of which 2.5-5 were first author papers (median = 5), of which 2-3.5 were in Q1 journals (median = 3).

# Notes

- I did not account for the type of paper.
- For other caveats to this type of data, [see this post from Dynamic Ecology](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2024/05/02/how-many-papers-do-you-typically-need-to-receive-an-nserc-cgs-pgs-or-post-doctoral-fellowship-heres-the-data/).

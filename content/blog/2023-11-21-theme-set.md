`theme_set()` takes theme objects as its argument, and it will apply it to all subsequent ggplots. For example, you can do `theme_set(theme_bw())` and it'll apply `theme_bw()` to all your ggplots. I personally like cowplot::theme_cowplot() as a starting theme to modify.

You can also use ggplot-style addition to add multiple theme objects (and `theme_set()` will apply them all to the ggplots.

Helpful for consistency across all your figures - no more copy and pasting `theme()`s.

```r

library(ggplot2)

ggplot2::theme_set(cowplot::theme_cowplot(line_size = 0.25, font_size = 10) +
                     theme(axis.ticks.length = unit(-3, "pt"),
                           legend.title = element_blank()))

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = Species, color = Species, shape = Species),
             stroke = 0.25,
             size = 3) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 23, 24)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.5,9), breaks = seq(0, 9, 3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.5,9), breaks = seq(0, 9, 3)) +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, 0.85),
        legend.text = element_text(face = "italic"))

```

# Methods

I downloaded publicly available names of researchers that received NSERC Postdoc Fellowships (PDFs) in the research subjects of Evolution and Ecology (Evo. & Eco.) and Plant and Tree Biology (Plant & Tree Bio.) from 1990-2023.

Winners of the NSERC PDFs from 1990-2020 were available from the [Awards Database](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/ase-oro/index_eng.asp), whereas winners from 2020-2023 were available on [Competition Results](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/FundingDecisions-DecisionsFinancement/ScholarshipsAndFellowships-ConcoursDeBourses/index_eng.asp) pages.

I looked them up on Google Scholar using the *[scholar](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/scholar)::get_scholar_id()* to get their Scholar ID. *scholar::get_profile()* was used to retrieve the Areas of Interest listed in their Google Scholar profile. If the Areas of Interest were missing or if they looked wrong, I manually looked them up. Names that did not return Areas of Interest were also manually looked up.

I then used *‌scholar::get_publications()* to download a list of their publications. First-author papers were counted where the lastname of the first author (first in the list) was detected in the awardee's name. I filtered for papers that were published during or before the competition year.

To filter out non-peer-reviewed publications, I only counted papers published in journals listed in Scimago (using [ikashnitsky/sjrdata](https://github.com/ikashnitsky/sjrdata)).

Outliers were manually checked.

# Results

- I downloaded profiles for 180 Evo. & Eco. and 46 Plant & Tree Bio. PDF winners.
- In the year that they applied, 50% of Evo. & Eco. winners had 2–6 first author pubs (median = 4) and 50% of Plant & Tree Bio. winners had 1.25–4 first author pubs (median = 2.5).

# Notes

- I did not account for the type of paper. So papers like reviews, commentaries, and editorials are still "first-author" papers.
- For other caveats to this type of data, [see this post from Dynamic Ecology](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2024/05/02/how-many-papers-do-you-typically-need-to-receive-an-nserc-cgs-pgs-or-post-doctoral-fellowship-heres-the-data/).

# Code and data

The code and data are deposited on my Github. You might find ways to improve it.

`between(x, left, right)` is the same as `x >= left & x <= right`, which means you can use it to filter for specific parts of your data! For instance, for my *C*<sub>i</sub>* *A*-*C*<sub>i</sub> data, I need to filter for just the initial slopes of each *A*-*C*<sub>i</sub> response measured at a different PAR.

```r

cstar_aci_data <- aci_data %>%
  filter(Obs %>% between(4, 8) |
           Obs %>% between(20, 25) |
           Obs %>% between(29, 34) |
           Obs %>% between(38, 43) |
           Obs %>% between(47, 52))

```

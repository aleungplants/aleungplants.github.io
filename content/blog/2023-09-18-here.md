I have a Windows desktop and a macOS laptop. I share files between them using OneDrive, provided by my institution. The root directory of OneDrive on my laptop is `/Users/art/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive`, but on my desktop it's `C:/OneDrive`. Without having to edit the working directory of my R scripts, how can I switch between the two devices while working on the same script? Or if I am to send an R script to a colleague, how do I ensure it will work regardless of where they put the script?

## `here` package in R

This package makes it easy to work with filepaths relative to the script or a pre-defined project folder.

If you run `here()`, it will return the directory in which your file is located.

```r
here::here()

## [1] "/Users/art/Documents/Project/Scripts"
```

String arguments within `here()` will append those strings to that filepath, separated by `/` if there are multiple strings (whether or not they exist).

```r
here::here("Folder")
## [1] "/Users/art/Documents/Project/Scripts/Folder"

here::here("Folder", "File.txt")
## [1] "/Users/art/Documents/Project/Scripts/Folder/File.txt"

here::here("Folder/File2.txt")
## [1] "/Users/art/Documents/Project/Scripts/Folder/File2.txt"
```

This will work if I moved this "Scripts" folder (which contains this R Markdown document).

But let's say we have a file in `Project/Data` that we want to access. (Without doing anything else, `here()` only allows us to work within the `Scripts` folder.) We can use `i_am()` from the `here` package to define a project folder; this kind of like a working directory, but it is *relative* to the file you are working in. It takes a string that is the filepath relative to your desired project folder.

Here are a few examples, first for illustration defining `Documents` as the project folder, then defining `Project` as the project folder.

```r
here::i_am("Project/Scripts/here.Rmd")
## here() starts at /Users/art/Documents

here::here("Data")
## [1] "/Users/art/Documents/Data"

here::i_am("Scripts/here.Rmd")
## here() starts at /Users/art/Documents/Project

here::here("Data")
## [1] "/Users/art/Documents/Project/Data"
```

We can then work within the `Data` folder. Here is an example where I make a folder in the `Project` folder and write/read files to that folder

```r

dir.create(here::here("Data")) # make the Data folder
readr::write_csv(iris, here::here("Data", "iris.csv")) # write iris to a csv
head(readr::read_csv(here::here("Data", "iris.csv"))) # look at the csv
